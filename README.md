### // I write code. Sometimes it works.


## üß† About Me

Backend-heavy, infra-obsessed.
Good with containers, bad with feelings.
Mostly building things no one asked for, but everyone ends up using.
Currently engineering chaos.

I don‚Äôt "aspire" to be anything. I just build.

`React` ‚Ä¢ `Next.js` ‚Ä¢ `FastAPI` <br>
